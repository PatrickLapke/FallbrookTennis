I developed a cross-platform mobile booking application for the Fallbrook Tennis and Racquet Club, located in Southern California, to address the rapidly growing popularity of pickleball in the USA and resolve the accompanying booking challenges.

The project, constructed using the MERN stack and React-Native, adopts a sprint-based iterative approach. It is being crafted in a real-world learning environment, with aspirations for a future release. The application has a variety of functionalities, including password-reset, form validation, login/logout with JWT Tokens, and the booking/deletion of tennis and pickleball slots, along with registration features. The current code for this application can be accessed on my GitHub, and I have posted screenshots below for a more visual perspective.

In addition to the development aspect, this project encompasses a wide range of topics, such as stakeholder evaluation, requirements gathering, high and low-level design, and testing/evaluation. Engaging in this comprehensive approach allowed me to traverse the entire software engineering lifecycle, thereby gaining a rich and valuable understanding. Further details on these topics can be found in the dissertation attached.
